==> One index should be created while creating the table itself.
==> If the index was changed in between:
    * Additional time would be taken to index the whole db.
    * All the duplicate keys will be removed and only the latest one will remain.
==> File name is as the tablename.


==> Only one index allowed now.

==> Table index will act like a write through cache. When ever the cache is updated the physical capy is also updated along with it.

==> Have to load index if any of the operations are done.

==> Free up spaces.

==> Modification can be done using inserting a second time.

==> Change the hash table to balanced tree.

==> Test with large number of insertions

        To be implemented:
        createdb DBNAME;
        destroydb DBNAME;
        opendb DBNAME;
        closedb;
        destroy RELATION_NAME;
        load RELATION_NAME from FILENAME;
        project into RELATION_NAME from RELATION_NAME ( ATTR_NAME [ , ATTR_NAME ]* );
        join into RELATION_NAME ( RELATION_NAME . ATTR_NAME, RELATION_NAME . ATTR_NAME );
 

==> Implement drop index DONE
==> Test deletion DONE



==> check if the input is correct
==> implement support for float
